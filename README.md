# Slot using Flask and [JyServer](https://pypi.org/project/jyserver/)

# Description
Created while learning JyServer to control the DOM with flask. This is part of my learning of flask to use within my software engineering class final group project. I had been writing python code for a slot and decided I wanted to make a UI for it and using jyserver was perfect since I needed to learn flask for my software engineering class final group project.
Must install flask and jyserver
```
pip install Flask
pip install jyserver
```

Run slotsite.py and it will start a localhost server
